          <p>THINGS TO NOTE: <br /></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Player names are their <span class="fw-bold">DISPLAY NAME</span> and not Roblox username, meaning some people can share names and
              accordingly share data (Rare case but should still be mentioned). The reason for this is that i don't have easy access to everyone's usernames through the guild.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a player were to change their
              <span class="fw-bold">Display</span> name then their data might not correctly combine for 'All Seasons' as future data is added.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the data is noted down within 1-5 days after a season has ended, roles might not be up to date and
              some players may be missing
            </li>
            <li>
              Under 'All Seaons', points are combined from all matching <span class="fw-bold">Display</span> names and
              only the role from the most recent season is taken into account
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
            I'll be updating this page with new data i collect after every season starting from Season 9
          </p>
          <p>
            I also plan on adding more information, as well as personal graphs for each player.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic opacity-75">
            This is however very conceptual at the moment, until i figure out a solution to the duplicate player problem.
